# Hi, I'm Leonardo Ribeiro 👋

</div>

I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering at FEUP.
Here you can find a selection of projects I’ve developed throughout my academic journey. These projects reflect my interest in problem-solving, software development, and continuously learning new tools and concepts. I enjoy turning ideas into practical solutions and using each project as an opportunity to grow as an engineer and developer.
